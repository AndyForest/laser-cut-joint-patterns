# Laser Cut Joint Patterns

The purpose of this git repository is to share and keep track of various patterns for laser cutting. I started it just to help keep these patterns straight for myself as I find myself looking through old files to find the best version of various patterns that I use over and over again. I'll update it with patterns as I use them.

The patterns are .svg and Illustrator .ai files, and are meant to be copied and pasted into designs as needed.

They include:

- Joints for connecting materials together with pressure fitting, bolts, etc.
- Patterns for flexible "living hinges"
- Patterns for simple mechanisms such as pivot points
- Patterns for more complex mechanisms such as a gumball hopper

All are welcome and encouraged to contribute! 

Feel free to request new patterns here on Github, or at https://www.reddit.com/r/lasercutting/
